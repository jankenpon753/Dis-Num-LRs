\section*{Functions}
The functions used to do the three methods in MATLAB are as such with brief description of each of them:
\begin{description}
    \item[for loop] The for loop is used to keep the programme running within a specific range. After finishing the process, the final value is passed on to the next programming lines.
    \item[plot] The Taylor's series of sine waves was plotted using the plot function. In this function, we must provide the x and y values at a specific moment, and the function will plot the diagram based on the values.
    \item[hold on, hold off] These commands govern how numerous graphs are plotted on the same axes. When we use hold on, we keep the current plot and axis attributes and add any subsequent plots to the existing graph. When we use hold off, the properties of the axes are reset to their defaults, and any new plots replace the current ones.


\end{description}
These function are the newly learned ones for these experiments.\cite{matlab}
